### 🤷‍♂️ What does it do - and why Marmaray?
Marmaray is a public transportation service for citizens living in both Kocaeli and İstanbul. Marmaray, alongside with İstanbul's own subway service, is commonly used in Turkiye, transporting more than one hundred thousand individuals every single day.
For this reason, Marmaray sometimes can be busy, causing passengers to lose the ability to see where they are/listen or get attention to the announcements. Sometimes, people may want better ways to get notified or they might have vision or hearing problems, rarely both.

### 🤔 What can (or did) we do?
To reduce distractions and help you maintain your focus, when you're approaching a station, Marmarotay fetches the correct data and reads it aloud. Or, when you use your phone, it sends you notifications!

### 💖 Why it's free?
